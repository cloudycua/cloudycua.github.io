After diligently creating new branches and merging them many lessons ago, I promptly pushed that knowledge to the recesses of my mind once I realized that clicking on the blue "Open IDE" button took care of everything for you. Since my code magically saved itself and loaded whenever I clicked the button, git clones and commit pushes were totally unnecessary. Or so I thought until the CLI Data Gem Project. If it hadn't been for the requirement to commit early and often with meaningful messages, it might have been a very long time before I realized how easy and useful it is to clone and commit my changes. Re-learning how to do this now with better context has also reminded me how git and github are tools for programmers to collaborate.
