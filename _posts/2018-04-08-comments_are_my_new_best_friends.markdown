I remember thinking my first C++ assignment in college was so elegant and minimalist that it spoke for itself. Sadly, the instructor didn't agree and gave me a 70 because I didn't write a single comment. While I learned to go back and add comments to my programs to explain what each section did, the Tic-Tac-Toe with AI final project was the first time that I realized that comments are a working tool. 

"Write the code you wish you had." Since all the lessons come with tests that tell you what you need to code for, the value of Avi's advice didn't really kick in for me until I challenged myself to make my computer AI's playing strategy unbeatable. Going move-by-move to figure out the different possibilities for every scenario, it was invaluable to be able to label which moves I was working on and what I needed that section to do. As a table of contents, it was easy to find which section of code needed to be reworked because the computer didn't respond with the best move. As a description, I could see exactly what I thought my code was supposed to do. As a working note, I was able to break down what each move or possible countermove should be into a series of mini-problems to solve. 

Working through the CLI Data Gem project taught me an equally important facet of my new best friend, the ability to comment out your lines of code. My initial scrape for url data spans nine webpages and there's a pretty significant lag time when you scrape all the data. Once I knew I could read all nine webpages, I only needed one or two pages to test out the other parts of my program. When developing my code and problem solving, it's been incredibly useful to comment out lines of codes I thought were causing problems, store lines of code I was thinking of using or wasn't ready to give up on yet, put sections of html I was trying to scrape, or samples of the scraped data.
