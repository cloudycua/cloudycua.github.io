I've always wanted to learn how to code, but never knew where to start. Then I found Flatiron. I love that they give you the tools and autonomy to learn on your own using baby steps. Instead of staring at a blank screen trying to conjure up what you learned in class, their labs break the program down into smaller problems and only cares that you came up with the result. It teaches you to be resourceful and that there are many solutions. Like anything else though, what you get out of it is what you are willing to put into it.
